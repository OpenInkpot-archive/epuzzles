msgid "bridges"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Bridges</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a set of islands distributed across the playing area. Each island contains a number. Your aim is to connect the islands together with bridges, in such a way that:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>    * Bridges run horizontally or vertically.</p>\n"
"<p>    * The number of bridges terminating at any island is equal to the number written in that island. </p>\n"
"<p>    * Two bridges may run in parallel between the same two islands, but no more than two may do so.</p>\n"
"<p>    * No bridge crosses another bridge.</p>\n"
"<p>    * All the islands are connected together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are some configurable alternative modes, which involve changing the parallel-bridge limit to something other than 2, and introducing the additional constraint that no sequence of bridges may form a loop from one island back to the same island. The rules stated above are the default ones.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1> Bridges controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid: if possible the cursor will always move orthogonally, otherwise it will move towards the nearest island to the indicated direction. Pressing the \"Ok\" key followed by a cursor key will lay an island in that direction (if available); pressing the \"9\" followed by a cursor key will lay a ‘non-bridge’ marker.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Doing this again when a bridge is already present will add another parallel bridge. If there are already as many bridges between the two islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by default), the same dragging action will remove all of them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can mark an island as finished by pressing the \"Ok\" key twice.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Violations of the puzzle rules will be marked by cross:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>    * An island with too many bridges will be crossed.</p>\n"
"<p>    * An island with too few bridges will be crossed if it is definitely an error (as opposed to merely not being finished yet): if adding enough bridges would involve having to cross another bridge or remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island has been highlighted as complete.</p>\n"
"<p>    * A group of islands and bridges may be crossed if it is a closed subset of the puzzle with no way to connect it to the rest of the islands. For example, if you directly connect two 1s together with a bridge and they are not the only two islands on the grid, they will light up red to indicate that such a group cannot be contained in any valid solution.</p>\n"
"<p>    * If you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow loops in the solution, a group of bridges which forms a loop will be crossed.</p>"

msgid "fifteen"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Fifteen</h1>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The old ones are the best: this is the good old ‘15-puzzle’ with sliding tiles. You have a 4×4 square grid; 15 squares contain numbered tiles, and the sixteenth is empty. Your move is to choose a tile next to the empty space, and slide it into the space. The aim is to end up with the tiles in numerical order, with the space in the bottom right (so that the top row reads 1,2,3,4 and the bottom row reads 13,14,15,space).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Fifteen controls</h2>\n"
"<p> The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the space in the direction indicated (moving the space in the opposite direction). </p>"

msgid "flip"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Flip</h1>\n"
"<p>You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark. Your aim is to light all the squares up at the same time. You can choose any square and flip its state from light to dark or dark to light, but when you do so, other squares around it change state as well.</p>\n"
"<p>Each square contains a small diagram showing which other squares change when you flip it.</p>\n"
"<h1>Flip controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Use the cursor keys to choose a square and \"Ok\" key to flip.</p>"

msgid "rect"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Rectangles</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a grid of squares, with numbers written in some (but not all) of the squares. Your task is to subdivide the grid into rectangles of various sizes, such that (a) every rectangle contains exactly one numbered square, and (b) the area of each rectangle is equal to the number written in its numbered square. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Rectangles controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Use the cursor keys to move the position indicator around the board. Pressing the \"Ok\" key then allows you to use the cursor keys to drag a rectangle out from that position, and pressing the \"Ok\" key again completes the rectangle. Using the \"9\" key instead of the return key allows you to erase the contents of a rectangle without affecting its edges, as above.</p>"

msgid "slant"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Slant</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a grid of squares. Your aim is to draw a diagonal line through each square, and choose which way each line slants so that the following conditions are met:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>     * The diagonal lines never form a loop.</p>\n"
"<p>     * Any point with a circled number has precisely that many lines meeting at it. (Thus, a 4 is the centre of a cross shape, whereas a zero is the centre of a diamond shape – or rather, a partial diamond shape, because a zero can never appear in the middle of the grid because that would immediately cause a loop.)</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Slant controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing the \"Ok\" or \"9\" keys will place a \\ or a /, respectively, and will then cycle them between the three possible square contents.</p>"

msgid "twiddle"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Twiddle</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Twiddle is a tile-rearrangement puzzle, visually similar to Sixteen (see chapter 6): you are given a grid of square tiles, each containing a number, and your aim is to arrange the numbers into ascending order.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In basic Twiddle, your move is to rotate a square group of four tiles about their common centre. On more advanced settings, you can rotate a larger square group of tiles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Joystick buttons move frame. Use \"OK\" button to rotate pieces inside the frame.</p>"

msgid "pegs"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Pegs</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a peg by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) to a vacant hole on the other side. Your aim is to remove all but one of the pegs initially present.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it is an obstacle which you must work around.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Pegs controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around the board. Pressing the \"Ok\" key while over a peg, followed by a cursor key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal move).</p>"

msgid "solo"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Solo</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a square grid, which is divided into as many equally sized sub-blocks as the grid has rows. Each square must be filled in with a digit from 1 to the size of the grid, in such a way that</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>* every row contains only one occurrence of each digit</p>\n"
"    <p>* every column contains only one occurrence of each digit</p>\n"
"    <p>* every block contains only one occurrence of each digit.</p>\n"
"    <p>* (optionally, by default off) each of the square's two main diagonals contains only one occurrence of each digit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You are given some of the numbers as clues; your aim is to place the rest of the numbers correctly.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Under the default settings, the sub-blocks are square or rectangular. The default puzzle size is 3×3 (a 9×9 actual grid, divided into nine 3×3 blocks).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Use joystick buttons to move cursor.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you press \"OK\"  and then type a number, that number will be entered in the square as a ‘pencil mark’. You can have pencil marks for multiple numbers in the same square. Squares containing filled-in numbers cannot also contain pencil marks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a particular square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a particular number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given square, or anything else you feel like.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To erase a single pencil mark, move cursor to the square, press \"OK\", and type the same number again.</p>"
