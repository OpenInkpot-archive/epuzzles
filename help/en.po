msgid "bridges"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Bridges</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a set of islands distributed across the playing area. Each "
"island contains a number. Your aim is to connect the islands together "
"with bridges, in such a way that:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>    * Bridges run horizontally or vertically.</p>\n"
"<p>    * The number of bridges terminating at any island is equal to the "
"number written in that island. </p>\n"
"<p>    * Two bridges may run in parallel between the same two islands, "
"but no more than two may do so.</p>\n"
"<p>    * No bridge crosses another bridge.</p>\n"
"<p>    * All the islands are connected together.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>There are some configurable alternative modes, which involve changing "
"the parallel-bridge limit to something other than 2, and introducing the "
"additional constraint that no sequence of bridges may form a loop from "
"one island back to the same island. The rules stated above are the "
"default ones.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1> Bridges controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid: if possible "
"the cursor will always move orthogonally, otherwise it will move towards "
"the nearest island to the indicated direction. Pressing the \"Ok\" key "
"followed by a cursor key will lay an island in that direction (if "
"available); pressing the \"9\" followed by a cursor key will lay a ‘non-"
"bridge’ marker.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Doing this again when a bridge is already present will add another "
"parallel bridge. If there are already as many bridges between the two "
"islands as permitted by the current game rules (i.e. two by default), the"
" same dragging action will remove all of them.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can mark an island as finished by pressing the \"Ok\" key "
"twice.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Violations of the puzzle rules will be marked by cross:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>    * An island with too many bridges will be crossed.</p>\n"
"<p>    * An island with too few bridges will be crossed if it is "
"definitely an error (as opposed to merely not being finished yet): if "
"adding enough bridges would involve having to cross another bridge or "
"remove a non-bridge marker, or if the island has been highlighted as "
"complete.</p>\n"
"<p>    * A group of islands and bridges may be crossed if it is a closed "
"subset of the puzzle with no way to connect it to the rest of the "
"islands. For example, if you directly connect two 1s together with a "
"bridge and they are not the only two islands on the grid, they will light"
" up red to indicate that such a group cannot be contained in any valid "
"solution.</p>\n"
"<p>    * If you have selected the (non-default) option to disallow loops "
"in the solution, a group of bridges which forms a loop will be "
"crossed.</p>\n"

msgid "fifteen"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Fifteen</h1>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The old ones are the best: this is the good old ‘15-puzzle’ with sliding "
"tiles. You have a 4×4 square grid; 15 squares contain numbered tiles, and"
" the sixteenth is empty. Your move is to choose a tile next to the empty "
"space, and slide it into the space. The aim is to end up with the tiles "
"in numerical order, with the space in the bottom right (so that the top "
"row reads 1,2,3,4 and the bottom row reads 13,14,15,space).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Fifteen controls</h2>\n"
"<p> The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the space in the "
"direction indicated (moving the space in the opposite direction). </p>\n"

msgid "flip"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Flip</h1>\n"
"<p>You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark. Your aim is to "
"light all the squares up at the same time. You can choose any square and "
"flip its state from light to dark or dark to light, but when you do so, "
"other squares around it change state as well.</p>\n"
"<p>Each square contains a small diagram showing which other squares "
"change when you flip it.</p>\n"
"<h1>Flip controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Use the cursor keys to choose a square and \"Ok\" key to flip.</p>\n"
"\n"

msgid "twiddle"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Twiddle</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Twiddle is a tile-rearrangement puzzle, visually similar to Sixteen "
"(see chapter 6): you are given a grid of square tiles, each containing a "
"number, and your aim is to arrange the numbers into ascending order.</p>"
"\n"
"\n"
"<p>In basic Twiddle, your move is to rotate a square group of four tiles "
"about their common centre. On more advanced settings, you can rotate a "
"larger square group of tiles.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Joystick buttons move frame. Use \"OK\" button to rotate pieces inside"
" the frame.</p>\n"

msgid "pegs"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Pegs</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a peg "
"by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) to a "
"vacant hole on the other side. Your aim is to remove all but one of the "
"pegs initially present.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A "
"space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it is "
"an obstacle which you must work around.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Pegs controls</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You can use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around the "
"board. Pressing the \"Ok\" key while over a peg, followed by a cursor "
"key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal move).</p>\n"

msgid "solo"
msgstr ""
"<h1>Solo</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You have a square grid, which is divided into as many equally sized "
"sub-blocks as the grid has rows. Each square must be filled in with a "
"digit from 1 to the size of the grid, in such a way that</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>* every row contains only one occurrence of each digit</p>\n"
"    <p>* every column contains only one occurrence of each digit</p>\n"
"    <p>* every block contains only one occurrence of each digit.</p>\n"
"    <p>* (optionally, by default off) each of the square's two main "
"diagonals contains only one occurrence of each digit.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You are given some of the numbers as clues; your aim is to place the "
"rest of the numbers correctly.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Under the default settings, the sub-blocks are square or rectangular. "
"The default puzzle size is 3×3 (a 9×9 actual grid, divided into nine 3×3 "
"blocks).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Controls</h1>\n"
"<p>Use joystick buttons to move cursor.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you press \"OK\"  and then type a number, that number will be "
"entered in the square as a ‘pencil mark’. You can have pencil marks for "
"multiple numbers in the same square. Squares containing filled-in numbers"
" cannot also contain pencil marks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The game pays no attention to pencil marks, so exactly what you use "
"them for is up to you: you can use them as reminders that a particular "
"square needs to be re-examined once you know more about a particular "
"number, or you can use them as lists of the possible numbers in a given "
"square, or anything else you feel like.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To erase a single pencil mark, move cursor to the square, press "
"\"OK\", and type the same number again.</p>\n"
