<h1>Twiddle</h1>

<p>Twiddle is a tile-rearrangement puzzle, visually similar to Sixteen (see chapter 6): you are given a grid of square tiles, each containing a number, and your aim is to arrange the numbers into ascending order.</p>

<p>In basic Twiddle, your move is to rotate a square group of four tiles about their common centre. On more advanced settings, you can rotate a larger square group of tiles.</p>

<h1>Controls</h1>
